## Learning Objectives  
* students will be able to create a single resource API using the express framework

## Requirements

#### Feature Tasks
* implement all code using ES6 Modules (import/export) using Babel
* create an HTTP server using `express`
* create a object constructor that creates a _simple resource_ with at least 3 properties
  * it can **not** have the same properties as the in-class sample code (other than the `id`)
  * a unique `id` property should be included *(node-uuid)*
  * include two additional properties of your choice
* use the JSON parser included with the `body-parser` module as a middleware component to parse the request body on `POST` and `PUT` routes
* persist your API data using the storage module and file system persistence

#### Server Endpoints
* **`/api/vi/resource-name`**
* `POST` request
 * pass data as stringifed JSON in the body of a **POST** request to create a new resource
* `GET` request
 * pass `/:id` as a route parameter to **GET** a specific resource (as JSON)
* `DELETE` request
 * pass `/:id` as a route parameter to **DELETE** a specific resource (as JSON)
 * this should return a 204 status code with no content in the body

#### Tests
* write a test to ensure that your api returns a status code of 404 for routes that have not been registered
* write tests to ensure the `/api/simple-resource-name` endpoint responds as described for each condition below:
 * `GET`: test 404, it should respond with 'not found' for valid requests made with an id that was not found
 * `GET`: test 400, it should respond with 'bad request' if no id was provided in the request
 * `GET`: test 200, it should contain a response body for a request made with a valid id
 * `POST`: test 400, it should respond with 'bad request' if no request body was provided or the body was invalid
 * `POST`: test 200, it should respond with the body content for a post request with a valid body
