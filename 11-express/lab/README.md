## Lab 11: Express

#### Author
Trevor Stam

### Feature Tasks

- implement all code using ES6 Modules (import/export) using Babel
  - create an HTTP server using express
  - create a object constructor that creates a simple resource with at least 3 properties
    - it can not have the same properties as the in-class sample code (other than the id)
    - a unique id property should be included (node-uuid)
    - include two additional properties of your choice
    - use the JSON parser included with the body-parser module as a middleware component to parse the request body on POST and PUT routes
    - persist your API data using the storage module and file system persistence
