## Learning Objectives  
* students will be able to work with application, router, and 3rd party middleware through the use of express.js
* students will be able to implement custom middleware through the use of express.js
* students will be able to create custom routers for a specific resource

#### Feature Tasks
* create a single resource `express` API that can handle **GET**, **POST**, and **PUT** requests
	* Choose your own resource, as long as it's not Note or Person 
* create an `error-middleware` module to handle errors and *use* it in your server file
* use a `cors-middleware` module that will allow for public use of your API
* create methods for filesystem and/or memory modules to handle **GET**, **POST**, and **PUT** operations.
* create a series of `acceptance tests` to test your **GET**, **POST**, and **PUT** routes
  * **hint:** *you'll want to use the `before` and `after` hooks provided by `jest` in order to create a test note and delete the note after the test has completed*

#### Stretch Tasks
* create a `model` module to handle dynamic models and *use* it in your server file
